# Check Supabase Connection from Browser

## Current Situation
- Node.js DNS fails (doesn't matter - we don't need it)
- Browser should be able to connect
- Need to verify what's actually failing in the upload

## Steps to Debug

### 1. Open Browser Console
1. Go to http://localhost:8084/admin
2. Press F12 or Cmd+Option+I
3. Go to Console tab
4. Clear console (trash icon)

### 2. Upload a Test Image
1. Click Gallery tab
2. Click "Upload Images/Videos"
3. Select 1 small image
4. Watch the console

### 3. Look for These Logs
```
üîµ Starting upload for: [filename]
File size: [size] bytes
File type: image/jpeg
Upload path: [path]
Bucket: gallery
Attempting upload to Supabase storage...
```

### 4. Check for Error
If it fails, you'll see:
```
‚ùå Upload error: [error object]
Error details: {
  message: "...",
  statusCode: "...",
  error: "...",
  name: "..."
}
```

## What to Report
Copy the **entire error details object** from the console.

This will tell us:
- 404 = Bucket doesn't exist
- 403 = Permission denied
- 401 = Auth failed
- Network error = Connection issue

## Alternative: Check Network Tab
1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Upload image
3. Look for failed requests (red)
4. Click on the failed request
5. Check Response tab for error message
