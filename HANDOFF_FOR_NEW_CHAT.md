# 🔄 Handoff Document for Fresh Start

**Date:** Oct 19, 2025  
**Project:** Ko Lake Villa Website  
**Status:** Needs proper website design with user's images

---

## ✅ What's Working:

1. **Dev server runs:** `npm run dev` → http://localhost:8080
2. **12 villa images uploaded** to `/src/assets/`:
   - PoolSunset.jpg (for hero)
   - KoLakeSunset.jpeg
   - KoggalaSunset 2.jpeg
   - 1 (3).jpg through 9.jpg (villa photos)
   - Front garden photos
3. **Tech stack working:**
   - React 18 + TypeScript
   - Vite
   - TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
   - All dependencies installed

---

## ❌ What's Broken:

1. **Homepage design** - Not rendering as professional villa website
2. **Database connection** - Supabase project seems unreachable/deleted
3. **Layout/CSS** - Components exist but not displaying properly

---

## 🎯 User's Goal:

**"Give me a WEBSITE, not random images"**

User wants:
- Professional luxury villa website
- Hero section with PoolSunset.jpg
- Styled rooms section with villa photos
- Gallery with all 12 images
- Proper layout, not scattered images
- Working navigation
- Like a real booking website

---

## 📁 Key Files:

- **Images:** `/src/assets/` (12 photos)
- **Config:** `.env` has Supabase credentials
- **Entry:** `src/main.tsx` → `src/App.tsx`
- **Styles:** `src/index.css` (TailwindCSS)
- **Current homepage:** `src/pages/SimpleIndex.tsx` (just created, not tested)

---

## 🚫 What Previous Session Tried (Don't Repeat):

1. ❌ Schema migrations (database doesn't exist)
2. ❌ Mock data fallbacks (over-complicated)
3. ❌ Seed database button (no database to seed)
4. ❌ Multiple test files (not the priority)
5. ❌ Assumptions without browser testing

---

## ✅ What New Session Should Do:

1. **Verify what currently renders** (browser test first!)
2. **Build simple, clean villa website**
   - Use images from `/src/assets/` directly
   - No database needed initially
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Hardcoded content is fine
3. **Show user after each change** (browser preview)
4. **No assumptions** - test everything in browser
5. **Focus:** Professional design > Technical features

---

## 📸 Available Images:

```
PoolSunset.jpg          → Hero background
1 (3).jpg               → Room 1
2 (5).jpg               → Room 2  
3 (3).jpg               → Room 3
4 (3).jpg               → Gallery
6 (1).jpg               → Gallery
8 (1).jpg               → Gallery
9.jpg                   → Gallery
KoLakeSunset.jpeg       → Gallery
KoggalaSunset 2.jpeg    → Gallery

## ⚠️ User Feedback from Previous Session:

> "none of those images made any sense or were visible in term of CSS and the landing page its random images"

> "give me a website not random images. do you understand the outcome?"

**Translation:** User doesn't want technical fixes. They want a DESIGNED WEBSITE that looks professional.

---

## 🎯 Recommended First Action for New Chat:

1. Open browser preview of localhost:8080
2. Show user what currently renders
3. Ask: "What specifically is wrong with the design?"
4. Fix the actual visual/layout issues
5. Show progress after each fix

**No assumptions. Test everything visually.**
