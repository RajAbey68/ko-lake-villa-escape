# ðŸŽ¨ Color Test - Sri Lankan Design System

**Testing URL:** http://localhost:8086

## What to Look For

### Current Homepage Should Show:
1. **Background:** Warm white/cream (not pure white)
2. **Text:** Dark charcoal (not pure black)
3. **Primary buttons:** Should use the existing color system
4. **Links:** Check if they're using the new accent colors

### Sri Lankan Colors Available:

**Kurumba Orange** (King Coconut)
- Primary: #FF9933 (vibrant orange)
- Use for: Main CTA buttons, highlights

**Lanka Maroon** (Flag)
- Primary: #8B2500 (deep maroon)
- Use for: Accents, headings

**Lanka Green** (Flag & Nature)
- Primary: #2D7A4F (forest green)
- Use for: Secondary buttons, nature elements

**Lake Blue** (Koggala Lake)
- Primary: #2596BE (lake blue)

## Next Steps

1. **Check the preview** - Does the site load?
2. **Inspect colors** - Are they different from before?
3. **Report back** - Tell me what you see

If colors look good, I'll apply them to all components.
If something looks wrong, I'll fix it immediately.

**No changes to actual pages yet - just the color system is loaded.**
